# Bank-Marketing

This was one of the few projects that was done as part of the Data Science course I did with University Of Chicago. This project was done by me along with 3 of my course mates.

The given dataset is of the Protugese Bank. The Bank conducted a Marketing Campaign on their customers to encourage them to subscribe the Bank's Fixed Deposit Service.

 i) To improve the current marketing campaign by using the dataset.

ii) To predict if the client of a bank will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit (variable y), by building a  various classification ML model and suggesting which would be the best model suited for the bank.
